# Library Managment System .Net Core 6 Web Application

Manage library day to day jobs using this web application.

Project Description:
The project is to build a system which can help operate a library more efficiently and minimize the
chances of errors.
The system will help the librarian do the daily operation of a library like keeping track of inventory,
manage book lending and returns, add new books to the system, remove books from the library,
manage lost or damaged books.
The system will have a reporting section which can be run to show the books which are in circulation
and can show the students which borrowed books from the library.
For security and recovery, the system will have a staff login and a backup option.
